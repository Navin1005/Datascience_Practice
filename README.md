# Machine Learning Models for Iris Dataset and Handwritten Digits Dataset
This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating the implementation of machine learning models on two classic datasets: the Iris dataset and the Handwritten Digits dataset. The models implemented include Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers, along with K-Fold Cross Validation for performance evaluation.

# Datasets
Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples, each representing one of three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica). Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Handwritten Digits Dataset
The Handwritten Digits dataset, also known as the MNIST dataset, is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It contains a total of 70,000 images, with 60,000 images used for training and 10,000 images for testing.
